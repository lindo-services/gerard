# Gerard

This project is a test to build a map component as a combination of [Openlayers](https://openlayers.org/), [Angular](https://angular.io/) and [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/).

## Naming

It is named a a tribute to [Gerardus Mercator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerardus_Mercator).

## Goal

I want to make an easy to use component library for maps. The library should be usable in a declarative style (from html tags) and in a programmable style, from typescript.

## Angular

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
